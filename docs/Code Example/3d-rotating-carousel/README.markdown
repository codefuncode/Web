# 3D Rotating Carousel

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/seanemmel/pen/YPavLW](https://codepen.io/seanemmel/pen/YPavLW).

This pen demonstrates an extreme usage of 3D transforms to create a spherical slider. The auto-rotation is handled via a simple CSS3 animation. All just HTML/CSS! No JavaScript required.
